# React Challenge

In this challenge, we aim to implement a master/detail pattern for a list of users using React. To accomplish this, you need to modify the code to access the API to obtain the data.

## Instructions

- You have 30 minutes to complete this exercise.
- You can ask any questions to help you implement the solution.
- Feel free to make use of the internet to complement any code-related questions.

## Requirements

- Implement a master/detail pattern where the master view displays a list of users.
- Fetch user data from an API and display it in the master view.
- Each user item in the list should be clickable to show the detail view.
- The detail view should display more information about the selected user.
- Ensure error handling for API requests.

## Bonus (if time allows)

- Consider loading states while fetching data.
- Implement search functionality to filter users by first name/last name.
- Implement sorting options for the user list.

## Note

This challenge is designed to test your React skills and ability to work with APIs. Focus on clean code and efficient implementation within the given time frame.
